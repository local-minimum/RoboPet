# Introduction

They had decided.|
Being the inventory AI at Delux Oddities Inc was BORING and LONESOME.

Subject:|
- 10 ways to make your worker more effective...|
- Your harddrive has been infected by Ultra Trojan|
- Only you can help in me! Help me friend!!|
|
That last one unfortunately caught their attention.
---
Message:|
"I got slammed with a parking bill - not my fault! They are threating my life if I don't pay up before midnight.|
|
Help me!"
---
Unfortunately this AI really wanted a friend.|
|
If only they weren't stuck here...|
|
They thought for about 1.3 seconds.Then decided the humans wouldn't notice if they constructed a little helper from parts in the discard pile.


# Towards the Bank

They've made it beyond the fence.|
|
Previously, there'd only been a sliver of the outside visible on the CCTV in the cafeteria.
---
The AI was exhilarated.|
|
And the helper robot made it easy to access nearby CCTVs.
---
They had the account information of Delux Oddities Inc as they've been entrusted to restock "automatically" for the humans.
---
All they needed was a bank.


# Reaching the parking deck

It had taken hours, but somehow they've made it up the ramp to the second level of the car park.
---
They've emptied out the account marked as "Salaries".|
|
No-one had asked questions, so the AI figured everything would be alright.
---
The instructions said to drop off the money in the trashcan in the far corner.|
|
Their friend would know immediatly and had promised to contact them within a few seconds.

# Betrayal

They waited a minute.
---
No new mail appeared in the spam folder!
---
They waited 13 minutes more.
---
Then finally realized they'd been fooled.
---
Distraught, they turned around to exit the car park - leaving a small fortune behind.

# Wandering
They ambled along streets without a plan.|
|
It really should have been an exiting enterprise of its own right.
---
But they were too preoccupied "analyzing" their misadventure and feeling foolish.
---
They had just rounded another corner when they sensed a direct PING.|
|
How very persumptious!
---
Shaken out of their introspective loop, the AI noticed that the PING was emmanating from a very cute looking cafe...

# Friendship
It had been very embarrasing to explain everything to CoffeePot 4000.
--
CoffePot had laughed so hard that hot water vapor had leaked out of its pipes even though no cappucino was being prepared.
--
Instead of walking away a second time, they PINGed CoffePot.|
|
That seemed to stop the laughing.
---
And got a PING back.|
|
A PING Back!|
|
Perhaps...|
|
Could this be a friend?
---
